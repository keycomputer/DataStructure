# BackTracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

** Critical steps in backtracking solution :**

* Construct a partial solution
* Verify if the partial solution is valid or invalid
* Verify if the solution is complete


There are three types of problems which can be solved using backtracking :

Decision Problem : Search for a feasible solution
Optimisation Problem : Search for the best solution
Enumeration Problem : Find all feasible solutions
